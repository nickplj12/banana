          <h1>Lore 'n More</h1>
        <p>After global warming has melted all the glaciers, humanity has found refuge near the poles, in a newly formed ocean. The only food they remembered to take with them was bananas, so they started planting. They have recently have found ways to genetically engineer more bananas, so there is no need for banana trees.</p>
        <h2>The Islands</h2>
        <p>In the banana archipelago, there are a few islands. Banana Island, Violence Island, Wooper Island, and some smaller unnamed islands.</p>
        <h3>Banana Island</h3>
        <p>This island is the main island of the Banana Islands. Violence on this island is <b style="color: red">illegal</b> and could result in a ban if the offender is without a permit. The only potentially life-threatening object here is the obama prism. You should always refrain from pressing the "obama prism respawn" button too many times, as that could cause an interdimensional rift that would likely cause the end of the world.</p>
        <h3>Violence Island</h3>
        <p>Explore the experimental weaponry on Violence Island, but be careful, because the effects of prolonged exposure to the weapons is not a part of this test.</p>
        <h3>Wooper Island</h3>
        <p>Wooper Island is a small island compared to the other islands, It is inhabited by two organisms, Engineer Gaming and Wooper. There is also a pile of whoppers on this island, near the sign with the word "whoppers" on it.</p>
        <h3>The Banana Factory</h3>
        <p>This factory contains a volcano as well as the factory that provides electricity. Be careful when operating the banana factory, as one wrong move could cause humanity to go extinct due to global warming.</p>
